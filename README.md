# **cmd-f Hackathon** 

The aim of our project is to help users distinguish between reliable and unreliable sources of medical information using a simple chrome extension that alerts the user about whether the source can be trusted. We hope our extension will potentially mitigate the negative effects of misinformation and allow users make educated choices about their health.
